# Decision-Tree-Classifier

Machine Learning Algorithm implemented purely from scratch using C++. The algorithm has been trained using the data contained in the train_data.txt file and tested with the data in test_data.txt.

## Decision Trees
- A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements

## How to Run
- To be able to test and play with the code, just type 'make' in Unix based terminals. You can change or modify the code to see the changes and maybe to improve the algorithm.
